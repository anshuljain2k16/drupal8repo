Feature: User login
  As a visitor
  In order to login to a portal
  I must be able to provide credentials

  Background: User is on login page
    Given I am on "user/login"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Successful login
    When I fill in the following:
      | Username | anshul |
      | Password | anshul |
    And I press "Log in"
    Then I should see "anshul.jain@fluke.com"
